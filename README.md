*Note: Triominos is a game marketed and sold by Pressman Toy Corporation.
In no way does this project intend to take away any rights that Pressman has regarding the trademark Triominos.*

The sole purpose of this project is to experiment with:
* how to implement game play for Triominos with Java (applying TDD and Clean Code practices as much as possible)
* how different drawing and placement strategies can optimize for likelihood of victory by using AI for automated gameplay
